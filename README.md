# MoodleGPT 1.1.3

This extension allows you to hide CHAT-GPT in a Moodle quiz. You just need to click on the question you want to solve, and CHAT-GPT will automatically provide the answer. However, one needs to be careful because as we know, CHAT-GPT can make errors especially in calculations.

## Chrome Webstore

Find the extension on the Chrome Webstore right [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moodlegpt/fgiepdkoifhpcgdhbiikpgdapjdoemko)
